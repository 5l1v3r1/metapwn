metapwn
=======
Automate metasploit with modules.  
Give it a config file and a directory and it will load modules from there.  
Example modules can be found in test\_modules  

**This is under development**

Don't expect it to work right.  
It uses python3 exclueively, so don't try to use python2. It won't work.
